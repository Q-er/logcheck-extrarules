## Testing rules
When developing a regex you probably need to test it more often than you want.

### Console
Use the following line to test the logcheck regular expressions.
Relevant logfiles (which logcheck checks) are /var/log/auth.log and /var/log/syslog

`sed -e 's/[[:space:]]*$//' /var/log/syslog | egrep     ''`

The documentation at [bluelightav.org](http://wiki.bluelightav.org/display/BLUE/Logcheck+administration) uses a different method. The regex is stored in a file to prevent possible mangling by the shell;
  * save the regex in `[file]`
  * `egrep --file [file] /var/log/syslog`

## Contributions
This repository contains rules contributed by others. If you want a rule to be added or consider some rules too lenient, please let me know. These logcheck rules keep my inbox (a bit) quieter.
